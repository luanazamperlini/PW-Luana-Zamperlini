          <p>
            I am a Web Developer, recently graduated from an immersive training
            program at Fullstack Academy.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Prior to my shift into web development, I was a children's caregiver
            with 9 years of experience. My work focused on providing the safety
            and well being of the kids.
          </p>
          <br>
            
            <p>For the last several years one of my biggest hobbies has been
            photography. So I though that when I wanted to make a career
            transition, photography would be the natural choice. However I found myself drawn to web development while trying to
            build my own photography website just for curiosity. 
            
            <p> I used a low code platform and ended up liking the frontend so much and started to experiment how things are created and organized at the backend as well. I then reached out to some friends who are also developers and asked for some clues of how I could learn more and decided to make this a career.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p>
            I then signed up for classes at FSA -one of the most prestigious
            boot camp schools- and couldn't be happier with my decision. I've
            undestood that my strengths include Adaptability, Problem Solving
            and Willingness to Learn. I have always been proud of being
            bilingual - I am originally from Brazil - but having signed up and
            concluded a boot camp on something completely new has made me very
            proud.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I am now looking for opportunities in a company that has a solid Team
            Work Structure. It would be exciting to learn from Senior Developers
            and sum my fresh knowledge to them.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            As a Junior Developer and a Lifelong Learner, I hope to contribute
            to the company's growth and be able to improve as a Developer so I
            can create amazing applications that will make positive changes on
            people's lives.
